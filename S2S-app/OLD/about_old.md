## Introduction

The potential value of the sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction has not yet been realized by stakeholders in the water management applications sector.  Aside from situations in which the S2S forecasts have low skill, other hurdles to adoption include: 

* misalignment of forecast products with users space-time analysis needs (which typically follow specific watershed boundaries or sets of point location);
* use of data formats that users cannot easily process into their analysis tools; 
* climatological biases in products based on raw model outputs relative to user climatologies; and 
* product verification that is tailored toward forecast producer diagnostic needs but is unusable or not relevant to water sector users. 
In each of these areas, more work can be done to bridge the gap to potential stakeholders and enhance quality, specificity, and accessibility hence usability of S2S predictions.  

The gaps highlighted above motivate this project's overarching goal of improving the understanding and application of S2S climate forecast products in the hydrology and water management sector, and operationalizing an initial product generation capability in this area at the NCEP Climate Prediction Center.  

This project will both address the hurdles to water stakeholder adoption described above and explore opportunities for skill enhancement through forecast post-processing as well as for developing products describing extremes at S2S time scales. The project will use S2S reforecasts (including CFSv2 and NMME, and other forecast sources as time permits) and real-time forecasts to apply and assess various post-processing approaches that may enhance the skill and reliability of the raw climate outputs. It will develop verification data products characterizing the predictability of surface precipitation and temperature predictions at bi-weekly, monthly, and seasonal time steps over the CONUS domain, at watershed-focused USGS Hydrology Unit Code (HUC) 4 and 2 spatial units. The benefits of statistical post-processing will be assessed against benchmarks (or baselines) from raw model outputs.  For the prediction of extremes potential, the project will apply spatial extremes models using hierarchical Bayesian framework with climate system covariates.    

This project is funded through the *MAPP - NOAA Climate Test Bed - Accelerating Transition of Research to Operations* grant. The PIs for this research project are Andy Wood (NCAR) and Rajagopalan Balaji (CU Boulder). Collaborators include personnel from the Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers, CPC, the National Water Center, the NOAA Earth Systems Laboratory, and the NOAA Regional Climate Services.

## Project Tasks
The objectives outlined above will be pursued through the following tasks:

1. The implementation of time-averaged S2S precipitation and temperature forecast products for USGS HUC2 and HUC4 spatial units over the CONUS domain based on two primary approaches: (a) use of bias-correction and statistical ensemble calibration to generate precipitation and temperature prediction products with enhanced skill; and (b) for benchmarking, simple mapping of raw model forecast precipitation and temperature outputs to HUC units.
2. The development and implementation of probabilistic forecasts of the probability of extreme events within the S2S forecast periods.
3. Verification of the prediction skill of products implemented through (1) and (2) to raise product awareness and enhance user's understanding of product suitability for follow-on modeling or decision support.
4. Research to operations transition of the approaches and results to CPC, requiring implementation, evaluation, dissemination and review by end users, validation and finally deployment of scripts and codes in the operational CPC setting.

Together, the tasks are expected to help expand current CONUS-wide climate prediction outputs to connect more effectively with the water management community, and to demonstrate skill enhancements through statistical post-processing.
